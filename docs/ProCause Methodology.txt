-- ProCause Methodology --

- given matrix (?) of variables (columns) and order/timestamps (rows), let user define treatment assignment and/or outcome function
- first, try the same as ProCause but with LSTM/transformer...
	- adjust preprocessing (was saved already though)
	- adjust mlp to lstm
- end goal:
	- generic for dimensions? (timing ok, but actions as well?)
